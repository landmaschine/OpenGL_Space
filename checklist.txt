1. Window Class -> dont singleton it!!  [x]
    glfw
    window Size
    framebuffer callback handled by window

2. RenderEngine or ECS ? [x]
    RenderEngine -> player..etc call to RenderEngine -> Simpler to implent, hard to scale
    ECS -> player..etc have rendercomponent -> hard to implement, super easy scale (actually simple to implement!)
    RenderEngine = GameObjects
    ECS = Entities with Components;
    ECS it is

3. shaderClass [x]
    loading & compiling shaders 

4. Input handling -> Command pattern [x] 
    NOTE: button release is a pain in the ass

5. OpenGL -> draw a triangle [x]
6. Make triangle move [x]

7. movement with physics engine [x]
    -> need posComponent from entity
    -> modifys velocity and position
    -> return calculated transform

8. rotate with mousePosition [x]
    problems: mousePosition polling needs window
           -> Compenent doesnt know anything of a Window
           -> window pointer goes wandering through source code...

9. projection [x]
    -> projection class orthographic
    -> also needs window Size
    -> view matrix
    -> projection matrix
        problem shader ID is not the same in rendercomponent and renderer, static? -> nope
        shader ID goes wandering

10. How does object move with input velocity? [x]
    in pyhics calc Transform... whoops

11. get center of triangle [x]
    -> no clue how to get center out of vertices...
    
12. Texture Rendering [x]
    -> the attempt of rendering a texture was a miserable failure
    -> its quite an astonishing view to watch a window with nothing in it, just a slugish greenish color.
    -> i dont get it to work

everything broken.

its working again!

13. adding ImGUI to project [x]
    it just works!!

14. view, projection, transformation with rotation matrix [x]
    -> everything working as i intented.
